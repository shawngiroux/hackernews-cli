This project is certainly a work in process to familiarize myself with Rust and creating terminal user interface.

I recommend compiling this project by using [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/):
```
$ cargo run
```

## Controls
```
k: traverse up
j: traverse down
enter: open story in default browser
c: open comments for story
```
